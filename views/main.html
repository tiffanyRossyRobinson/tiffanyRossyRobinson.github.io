    <p> "Tiffany is a superhero whoâ€™s day-job is programming. Unbeknownst to her colleagues, she is able to learn and tackle complex problems at rates previously thought impossible for the human mind. Despite her abnormal propensity for mastery, Tiffany is beyond humble as a co-worker. In short, if they ever establish a Justice League of programming, I would nominate Tiffany as a promising up and comer."</p>

    <p> "It has been a pleasure working with Tiffany throughout our final project. Her ability to work through problems and come up with creative solutions is nothing short of amazing. I was able to learn a lot just by watching how she worked through problems to come up with her own unique algorithms. Every task she took on was always clearly communicated and executed with precision, so that it made merging our work seamless. Her work far exceeded that of anyone in our class but she always remained humble. I look forward to seeing all of her great accomplishments in the future."</p>

    <p> "In a group project with Tiffany, she was a good leader and delegator, while still taking on a lot of the actual project itself. She helped work with me to find some answers, too. She was easy to work with and made the project go smoothly, and it put me at ease that she was on the team."</p>
