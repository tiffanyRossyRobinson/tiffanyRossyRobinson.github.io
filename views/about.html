  <p> My Name is Tiffany Rossy Robinson, and I am currently seeking a position as a developer. On August 7, 2015, I graduated from The Iron Yard in Charleston from the Front-End Engineering program. Now that I have completed this program I am ready to embark on my journey in this new career path! I am seeking a position that provides the opportunity to challenge myself daily, constantly learn, and create and build exciting products!</p>

<h5> Background </h5>
<div class="section">
<p> In December 2011, I graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso with my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering. It was in my undergrad that I was introduced to and fell in love with programming in courses that taught me C and Objective C. I applied for and received an internship with AT&T where my knowledge and experience in programming grew. I gained experience using Perl, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>

<h5> Discovering Me </h5>

<p> After graduation, I received a position with SAIC to work a DOD contracting job. The position was in an event called  <a href="http://www.arcic.army.mil/Initiatives/network-integration-evaluation.aspx">Network Integration Evaluation (NIE)</a> as a System Field Engineer. Although I loved participating in an event that upgraded and improved the soldier's network, I knew that I wanted to pursue my career in programming. I realized my attitude in my career did not match the excitment and joy I felt while programming in AT&T. I found that I thrived in a fun and challenging career where I had the opportunity to learn and be creative. Why couldn't I follow my passion? </p>
